# Excursions webpage

 A basic homepage built with HTML and CSS. Part of the Codecademy Web Developer curriculum. 

------------

## Notes: 

This is only a basic page without much need for complex styling - images and videos are already sized correctly and there is little requirement for IDs and classes. 

Simply an opportunity to work with a design/redline mock up and to share with git.
